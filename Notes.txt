-- Amazon EventBridge is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for developers to build scalable event-driven applications.

-- Event Bridge is an Event Bus that helps in integrating different AWS Services , and custom applications and SAAS Applications 

-- Earlier we have Cloud watch events , the only negative point is that , it did not support SAAS applications and custom applications outside from the AWS 

-- EventBridge was build for the same purpose , u can create effortless event-driven architectures

Eg 1 : u want to receive SNS notification every time production EC2 instance are terminated , this will be done by EventBridge

Eg 2 : automated deployment using code pipelines at 11PM everyday

Eg 3 : if a premier user deactivates himself from ur product , u want to :

- Send and email for feedback 
- Schedule Customer Representative call
- Send customised offers for that use 


-- these all things will done by the event Bridge and u can schedule the events also 

-- It is fully managed service 

-- pay what u use model 


Different Parts in EventBridge:


Working flow -----


Event Producer --> Event --> Amazon EventBridge event Bus --> Rule ---AWS Lambda , AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Simple Notification Service


--  Event producer : AWS Service / Custom applications / Third Party SaaS providers,

--  From the producers the event will generated , this will transform to the bus and it move to rules , in rules there are multiple rules and this rules will send to multiple targets 

-- A single rule may have multiple targets and max target is 5 ,all targets will process in the event in parallel


Important terms in EventBridge :

1 Event  : An Event indicated a change in an environment 

2 Rule   : A rule matches incoming events and routes them to targets for processing  

3 Target : target application of ur rule. A target process events 

Targets can include ec2 , lambda functions , kinesis streams , Ecs tasks,  , the target receive events in JSON format 

4 Event Bus : An event bus receives events. When u create a rule , u associate it with a specific event bus and rules is matched only to events received by that event bus 

- rule can not be create standAlone , it should have it's parent as EventBus

Components of EventBridge :

1 EventBridge Rule : A rule matches incoming events and sends them to targets for processing.

2 EventBridge Pipes : A pipe connects an event source to a target with optional filtering and enrichment.

3 EventBridge Schedule : A schedule invokes a target one-time or at regular intervals defined by a cron or rate expression.

4 EventBridge Schema registry : Schema registries collect and organize schemas.


EventBus : Usecases

if a premier user deactivates himself from ur product , u want to :

- Send and email for feedback 
- Schedule Customer Representative call
- Send customised offers for that use 


In the above example , the working flow will be like 


User deletes his subscription --> custom event is trigged --> rights custom event would be pass into the EventBus --> rule matching --> then it reaches to the targets , once the rule is matched  here then it sends to targets --> 1 the targets are Feedback service 2 Schedule call service 3 offers service

Example 1 

1  Schedule AWS Lambda Functions Using EventBridge


-- lambda scheduling use cases 

- Automated backups at EOD of ur applications 

- backend cleaning (including logs and temp files )

- consolidated reports after business hours , so lambda can trigger  Athena queries and can run any database queries and send to business stack holders through SNS 


- to schedule events u have two options 

1 to schedule  at fixed rate -- for every 1 minute 

2 Cron job (10 * * * * )

-- open console 

-- open lambda --> python 3.9 --> create function 

-- write python code to invoke lambda function

import json
from datetime import datetime

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # TODO implement
    currentTime = datetime.now()
    print("Time at which Lambda invoked" + str(currentTime))


-- give empty JSON to test {}

-- now go to Amazon eventBridge in console 

-- c.o create rule --> schedule --> continue to create rule --> schedule that run at regular intervals--> select 1 minute --> select lambda function --> create rule 

-- u can check in CloudWatch logs , for invoking is there or not 

--  the logs are generated 


-- if u want to monitor ur invocations --> Metrics --> all Metrics --> query --> choose AWS/events --> Myrule name 

- metric name = COUNT(invocation)

- filter by = Rulename = rule name that u have created in lambda function to test the function 

- choose number in right corner to see the no. of invocations 


-------------------------------------------

Example 2 : EventBridge with SNS 


-- AS we know that EventBridge will use for 2 process 

1 event-event process : when the event has occurred according to our rule then it will trigger to the targets 

2 schedule process : do schedule 

-- in the above example we have seen Schedule event

-- now event to event 

- for example the ec2 is stopped then it will send alert to the subscribers on SNS Topic 

-- open SNS in console --> create one topic --> standard --> create topic --> open topic -->create subscription --> add protocol email or phone number 

-- when ever the instance is getting stooped then I would like send an alert to all the subscribers 

-- this is called event-event process 

-- create one ec2 instance 

-- create rule in event bridge --> name --> rule with an event pattern --> in event pattern = select ec2 --> select event type as u want --> in Target1 choose AWS Service = SNS topic select SNS topic --> create rule 

-- do stop the instance 

-- u will get notification once the instance is get stopped 


--------------- now for schedule event 

-- create another rule , that is based on the time to stop the instance 

-- select schedule pattern option --> A schedule that runs at a regular rate, such as every 10 minutes. --> target = terminateinstanceAPI call --> u can also add another target to get notification 
 

-- the instance will get terminated after the time that u have specified 


-- this is simple basic example for schedule pattern
